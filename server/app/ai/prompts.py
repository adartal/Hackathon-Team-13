"""Bounded prompt construction for the math tutor.

The whole point of this module: keep adaptive prompts SHORT and SIZE-CAPPED.
The learner profile is rendered as a handful of enum lines, never free-form
prose, and the assembled tutor system prompt is asserted to stay under a hard
character budget so it can't silently grow as features are added.
